### Rules Governing the Use of the 9-1/2 inch Telescope'

1. Use of the telescope is restricted to persons who have undergone a checkout session with C. Knox, B. Janesh, or another member of the staff of the Department of Astronomy. A Google Spreadsheet of people authorized to use the telescope is kept by the department.

2. The telescope must be reserved in advance. The sign-up sheet is posted on a bulletin board outside of Sears Library 567. Reservations must be made in person or via email.

3. A user is allowed to sign up for a maximum of two nights at a time. This means that any user can have two nights scheduled that have not been used yet. When one of the scheduled nights has passed, another can be scheduled. The telescope is occasionally used for instructional purposes. The department reserves the right to schedule a block of time of up to five days to ensure the best available time in that window. 

4. The telescope sign-up sheet for the next month will be posted on the second Monday of the current month. 

5. The keys for the telescope must be picked up by 5:00 pm on the day that the telescope is to be used.
