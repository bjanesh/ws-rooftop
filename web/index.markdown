**Welcome to CWRU Astronomy's Rooftop Telescope!**{: .text-red-300} This page is intended to provide users of the telescope ("observers") with important information and instructions for the use of the telescope. These pages also contain a historical overview of the telescope.

If you're interested in using the telescope on your own, you need to complete an in-persone training seminar, which takes about one to two hours. You can schedule a training by emailing Charles Knox (cak4), Bill Janesh (bfj2), or Agnes Torontali (amt11) in the Department of Astronomy. Trainings are scheduled based on mutual convenience, weather, and may be combined for efficiency. Once you've been trained, you can sign up for dates to use the telescope on the calendar outside Sears Library 567 (dates are available on a first come, first serve basis).
