## The Dedication of the Warner and Swasey Observatory

### October 12th, 1920

## Presentation Address

### Ambrose Swasey

<hr/>

President Howe, and good friends:

To me this is indeed a happy occasion and I am pleased to express to you my appreciation of your presence here to assist in the dedication of this observatory. Mr. Warner and I have often been asked if building astronomical instruments is our only business, and sometimes I have answered, as President Howe has just indicated, that we get out money out of machinery and our glory out of telescopes. I want you to know, however, that while the monetary reward may have been meagre we have been amply compensated for all of our astronomical work.

For forty years we have been engaged in making astronomical instruments and it is always pleasant to call to mind the men we have known and with whom we have been associated in this work, and I am glad to mention some of them this afternoon. I need say but little concerning their work or achievements, as most of the names have become household words.

Professor Simon Newcombe, the greatest astronomer of his time. He occupied many prominent positions in the world of science and astronomy and in his later years was Director of the Nautical Almanac Office.

Professor Asaph Hall, also connected with the Naval Observatory, who discovered the two moons of Mars.

Professor Harkness and Eastman, two of the ablest astronomers of the Naval Observatory.

Professor Pickering, Director of the Harvard College Observatory.

Professor Young, of Princeton, beloved by all who knew him, whose textbooks on astronomy are known throughout this country. He began his work in astronomy at Hudson, in this state, and his little observatory, one of the oldest in the country, is still standing, although not now in use.

Professor Langley, at one time director of the Allegheny Observatory, and for many years Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Because of his fundamental work in the development of the aeroplane, his name will go down in history as "The Father of advanced aviation."

Professor Boss, Director of the Dudley Observatory at Albany, who was succeeded by his son Benjamin.

Professor Doolittle, of the Flower Observatory of the University of Pennsylvania. He did a great work with the Zenith Telescope in determining the variation in latitude. His son, Eric, who succeeded him, passed away only a few weeks ago.

Professor Maria Mitchell, that remarkable woman astronomer, Director of Vassar College Observatory.

Professor Stockwell, of our own city. One of the greatest mathematicians of our country who, for many years, was connected with this institution.

Professor Frost, Director of the Yerkes Observatory, where the great 40-inch refracting telescope is located.

Professor Burnham, of the same observatory, of whom it was said his keen eye when observing double stars was equal to several inches added to the diameter of the object glass.

Professor Barnard, also of the Yerkes Observatory, who, when at Lick Observatory, discovered the fifth satellite of Jupiter through the 36-inch telescope; the first four satellites having been discovered by Galileo in 1610, nearly three hundred years before. Four additional satellites have more recently been discovered, three at the Lick Observatory and one at Greenwich, making nine in all.

Doctor Hale, Director of Mt. Wilson Observatory, where such splendid work has been done with the 60-inch Reflecting Telescope and where the great 100-inch Telescope, the largest in the world, has recently been completed.

Doctor Plaskett, of the Dominion Observatory at Victoria, who for nearly two years has been obtaining such admirable results with the 73-inch Reflecting Telescope.

Professor Holden, the first Director of the Lick Observatory.

Professor Keeler, who succeeded Professor Holden as Director of the Lick Observatory.

Professor Cambell, the present Director of the Lick Observatory, the Dean of American astronomers. It is indeed a pleasure and an honor to have him with us on this occasion.

The Royal Astronomer Christie, of the Greenwich Observatory, on the other side of the Atlantic.

Professor Newhall, of Cambridge Observatory.

Sir Robert Ball, who has entertained and instructed thousands and even millions of people in Europe and in this country by telling them of the wonders of the heavens.

Professor Lourvy, Director of the Paris Observatory.

Paul and Prosper Henry, the able assistants of Professor Lourvy.

Professor Flammarion, whose imagination far exceeded the power of his telescope and who has entertained readers of astronomy in all parts of the world.

Alvin Clark, who has been called the "Father of modern great telescopes" and his two sons George and Alvin. These were men of real genius and rendered a great service to science in giving to the world the objectives of the 36-inch Lick Telescope and the 40-inch telescope at Yerkes Observatory.

Doctor Brashear, that man with a wonderful personality, who brought to his objectives and other optical surfaces, a refinement and perfection never before attained. When travelling with him in China a few years ago, although a stranger there, he seemed within a few weeks to become acquainted with the four hundred million people in that country, and they all called him "Uncle John!"

These men to whom I have referred stand out as first magnitude stars in the realm of astronomical science, and to have had some part in their great work for science and humanity is indeed glory enough and compensation enough.

This building, because of its admirable design and construction, tells its own story as to the purpose for which it was erected and to Messrs. Walker and Weeks, the architects, and Messrs. Crowell and Little, the builders, too much credit cannot be given. President Howe, we can but hope that for years and generations, this structure may prove to be the most helpful to this splendid educational institution in its work of training and developing young men for life's duties and responsibilities.
